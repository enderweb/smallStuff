This is a login simulator that is just a basic thing I put together. Nothing is really wiped if you get 3 tries wrong but I thought it would be a bit fun to add. I also added some extra code to make it so one attempt would not have an s at the end. I named the username farm and password tractor because I was listening to old country music
